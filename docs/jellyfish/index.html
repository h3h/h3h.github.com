<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Facebook Platform enables you to make your website more personalized and social. You can mix and match Facebook's APIs to best meet your goals:</p>

<p><button class="disabled">Disabled Button</button></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Registration + Login</strong> &mdash; With a single dialog, you can access data including a user's real name, email address, profile picture and list of friends.  Replace or supplement your user account system with Facebook to help drive signups and improve data quality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Engagement</strong> &mdash; With Facebook users comes their friends; incorporate these connections to make your product more engaging.  Social plugins like the <a href="../reference/plugins/like">Like button</a> and the <a href="../reference/plugins/activity">activity feed</a> enable you to offer social experiences with just a line of HTML. The <a href="../api">Graph API</a> enables you to integrate the social graph into your site in deep and compelling ways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Growth</strong> &mdash; You can publish content from your site into the social graph to reach your users' friends. The <a href="../reference/plugins/like">Like button</a> enables users to share your site's content back to their Facebook stream with one click. In addition, you can integrate pages deeply into the social graph via the <a href="../opengraph">Open Graph protocol</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This guide will walk you through the basics of creating a web application with some of these features. If you aren't sure where to start after reading this guide, check out the <a href="/showcase/">Platform showcase</a> for inspiration from other sites.</p>
