<h2>Why Jellyfish?</h2>

<p>I kept running into situations where I wanted to create a relatively simple
web site that had many static pages and a small amount of scripting on each.
Previously, I would have to create a separate .js file for each static page,
then loading each different .js file from each .html file.</p>

<p>Instead of worrying about all of these different .js files for a small
amount of scripting, I created Jellyfish. This way, I can write a single .js
file that controls all of the scripting across the site, partitioned by page
(or sets of pages). I can include the single .js file in my layout file and
avoid the headache of managing myriad .js files. Isn't that nice?</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<pre>
Jellyfish(function () {{"{"}}
  this.bloom('/about', function () {{"{"}}
    this.sting('#header/click', function (evt) {{"{"}}
      alert("Hi there.");
    });
  });
});
</pre>

<p>On the page with the URL <code>/about</code>, find the element matching the
<code>#header</code> selector and install a <code>click</code> event
listener.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Registration + Login</strong> &mdash; With a single dialog, you can access data including a user's real name, email address, profile picture and list of friends.  Replace or supplement your user account system with Facebook to help drive signups and improve data quality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Engagement</strong> &mdash; With Facebook users comes their friends; incorporate these connections to make your product more engaging.  Social plugins like the <a href="../reference/plugins/like">Like button</a> and the <a href="../reference/plugins/activity">activity feed</a> enable you to offer social experiences with just a line of HTML. The <a href="../api">Graph API</a> enables you to integrate the social graph into your site in deep and compelling ways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Growth</strong> &mdash; You can publish content from your site into the social graph to reach your users' friends. The <a href="../reference/plugins/like">Like button</a> enables users to share your site's content back to their Facebook stream with one click. In addition, you can integrate pages deeply into the social graph via the <a href="../opengraph">Open Graph protocol</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This guide will walk you through the basics of creating a web application with some of these features. If you aren't sure where to start after reading this guide, check out the <a href="/showcase/">Platform showcase</a> for inspiration from other sites.</p>
